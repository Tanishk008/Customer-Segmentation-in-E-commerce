# 🧠 Customer Segmentation with KMeans Clustering

This project uses **KMeans Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to segment customers (or any entities) based on numerical features in a dataset. Built and tested using **Google Colab**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- CSV Upload using Google Colab
- Missing value handling
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters
- KMeans clustering
- Dimensionality reduction via PCA
- Visualized cluster results

---

## 📊 Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn` (StandardScaler, KMeans, PCA)
- `google.colab` (for file upload)

---

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Open the provided Colab notebook.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Upload your `.csv` file when prompted.
4. View the elbow graph to choose the best number of clusters.
5. Get cluster assignments and PCA-based 2D visualization.
