## 🚀 Features
- CSV Upload using Google Colab
- Missing value handling
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters
- KMeans clustering
- Dimensionality reduction via PCA
- Visualized cluster results

## 📊 Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn` (StandardScaler, KMeans, PCA)
- `google.colab` (for file upload)
